Curses, how cruel is a fate such as this? My darling Witch Knight, the sun of my Earth, the only thing I wished was to never leave you behind, hence my hesitance to climb towards the mountain top even after I had discovered it. But I can feel the energy draining from my fingers, from my exhausted hands as I write this knowing full well that my time has run out, and I haven’t made my decision yet. I witnessed your magnificent beauty only a few cycles ago, and I know you’re so close to finding me again, yet my body will not listen… It crumbles as I etch these final words into the ground, so close to the peak of the mountain. I know that if I ever reached it… I would never see you again. My darling Witch Knight, perhaps this fate is better suited for me, as a memory of Mount Arar, a spirit endlessly waltzing with the shadows. Perhaps when the curse of the mountain is lifted, if it is ever lifted, we will all be able to bask underneath the incandescent sun together. What a beautiful sight it would be… but never as beautiful as you.
