{"inkVersion":20,"root":[["^I have decided to rest. I miss the shining spires of the university, and wish I could have seen them again, but I fear I was never any use to them anyway. I couldn’t make this climb alone, and my poor companion is worse off than me — embracing eternal stillness as if it were a gift, as if it were not the enemy of all learning! If my Seeker still lives when you find me, bid them to either climb or fall! It pains me greatly to think of them standing twilight vigil over me for Eternity, never growing and never resting. They will not listen, dear traveler, but please ask them anyway. The day you stop pursuing futile things is the day you join me, after all. I wish you luck on your climb, may the Sun’s light draw you ever upward.","\n","ev","str","^Close Final Message","/str","/ev",{"*":"0.c-0","flg":20},{"c-0":["\n","end",{"->":"0.g-0"},{"#f":5}],"g-0":["done",{"#f":5}]}],"done",{"#f":1}],"listDefs":{}}
