{"inkVersion":20,"root":[["^Is this how I am to die?! Defeated by <i>rope</i>?! I finally found my way to the staff-which-brings-music, but there is a problem. I suspect that damn lich affixed his staff to this tree many years ago when it was but a sapling. In the time since, the tree has grown, and the cord he used has become embedded deep in the wood as one of the great boughs grew around it. I have not the strength left to fell the tree. I would simply cut the cord, but that eternal bastard must have protected it with some kind of magic! <b>My weapon does nothing</b>! I have tried every implement I can think of. I can see now that <b>there must be some other item with the power to scotch the infernal fixture.</b> But alas, I have traveled the mountain with many a life and found not what I seek. Now, I can’t help but falter in my courage. The shadows come, and I leave this message such that I may be avenged against this tree and its tantalizations: <b>Find what is needed to cut the rope!</b>","\n","ev","str","^Close Final Message","/str","/ev",{"*":"0.c-0","flg":20},{"c-0":["\n","end",{"->":"0.g-0"},{"#f":5}],"g-0":["done",{"#f":5}]}],"done",{"#f":1}],"listDefs":{}}
