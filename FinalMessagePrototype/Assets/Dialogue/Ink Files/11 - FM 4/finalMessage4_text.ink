This damn chime is cracked. I’ve seen its sisters all over the slopes of the Mount, little magical things. I thought them one of the few helpful things in this damnable place. But this one gave up. I tried taking one of its sisters from elsewhere on the slopes, but they’re all rooted too tight into the ground…I have no <b>scholar’s chime staff</b>, and so I have no way across this gap…I’m sure there’s another way, I only need find it. But I tire of other ways, and I suspect only death awaits me at the summit. So, why not rest here, instead…
