{"inkVersion":20,"root":[["^Here I lay, forgotten, but unafraid of what’s to come. It is in these final moments that I cherish our climb the most, <b>my dearest friend, my Wizard Knight.</b> Have you found a purpose other than scaling this wretched mountain? I’ve realized how exhausted I am, how faint the idea of a mountain peak has become. I understand now, after all this time, there may not be a summit, only an endless climb for lost souls like you and I… Perhaps this is our punishment. But something about this final climb without you feels different, more lonely… more peaceful. I wonder, have you sought out your true love? I recall the fire in your eyes, the bright smile upon your face as <b>you dreamed of finding your Witch Knight</b>, the pride in your stance as you turned away from me before the shadows consumed us. The moment I woke up alone at the base of the mountain, I became dreadfully aware of the fact that even if there is a peak, I will never reach it, but I wonder… will you? Your love is strong enough to persist, even after death, even after failure. Should the day ever come that you two are not together, <b>I know the living will guard over the grave of the dead for eternity.</b> I could not be more glad, even though there will be no one to guard mine. If there is a peak, my greatest companion, I will meet you there.","\n","ev","str","^Close Final Message","/str","/ev",{"*":"0.c-0","flg":20},{"c-0":["\n","end",{"->":"0.g-0"},{"#f":5}],"g-0":["done",{"#f":5}]}],"done",{"#f":1}],"listDefs":{}}
